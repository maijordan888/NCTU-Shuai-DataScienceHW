scrawler.py is the original one which doesn't care about the hint assistant gave.
Hint: In test, it will be first to try the "crawl", so you could (or should) use the output from the crawl.

version2.0.0 came out after scrawler.py. It also forgot the hint but use the function to shorten the code.

version3.0.0 is the version which use the hint, and seems to be the final version.
